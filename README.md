My solutions for Coursera course More C# Programming and Unity

To play the game use:
'Space' to move ship forvard;
'Right' to turn ship to the right ('D' won't work, it made on purpose);
'Left' to turn ship to the left ('A' won't work, it made on purpose);
'Top' to turn ship to the top ('W' won't work, it made on purpose);
'Bottom' to turn ship to the bottom ('S' won't work, it made on purpose);
Left 'Ctrl' to shoot.

You shold shoot all asteroids to win the game. 
But be careful, if asterod collides a ship, the ship will be destroyed.

Good luck!
